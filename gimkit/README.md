##### Why?
So people who are suspicious will now think you are legit
#### Keybinds
- Keys: Hide Menu > C, Highlight > H, Big Answer > B, Input Answer > I, Hidden Answer > O
##### Why?
If a teacher, or someone who you don't want to get caught cheating with comes over, and can simply press C or another keybine to hide what you have open
#### Applying Themes Without Buying Them
- Show off.

#### Session Stealer
- Allows you to steal the session of any other player in the Gimkit match
> **NOTE:** You'll need the users Blueboat ID, and nobody can be connected to the ID
##### Why?
If for any reason, someone you are working with in your Gimkit gets disconnected, you can take their session to make sure they don't lose any progress while reconnecting
#### Upgrade Update
- Shows you the next upgrade $ amount and will be colored green if you can buy the upgrade
> **NOTE:** You'll have to open the shop to each category so it knows what level's you have
##### Why?
So you can visit the shop knowing what you are going to upgrade

## Usage:
