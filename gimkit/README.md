## Features:
#### Highlight Answer

> **NOTE:** Requires an update to the box (space, then enter)
#### Bigger Answer
- Makes the selection box of the correct answer the entire screen
#### Hidden Answer

##### Why?
So people who are suspicious will now think you are legit
#### Keybinds
- Keys: Hide Menu > C, Highlight > H, Big Answer > B, Input Answer > I, Hidden Answer > O
##### Why?
If a teacher, or someone who you don't want to get caught cheating with comes over, and can simply press C or another keybine to hide what you have open
#### Applying Themes Without Buying Them
- Show off.
#### Session Stealer
- Allows you to steal the session of any other player in the Gimkit match
> **NOTE:** You'll need the users Blueboat ID, and nobody can be connected to the ID
